2010-08-31  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.scm (chaton-alist->stree): Render nested lists in the value
	  of the map as an array in json mode.
	* chaton-viewer: Changed API to recognize "s=0" as a jsom mode which
	  returns the same info as Sexpr mode.  The default (missing 's')
	  behavior is a special format just for web interface.
	  THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: It breaks a client that sends
	  's' parameter with a value other than 1 and expects Sexpr.
	  Clients using chaton.client module won't break, for the module
	  already sends '1'.

	* chaton-apilogin: Allow returning result in json if "s=0" parameter
	  is given.
	* tests/apilogin.scm, tests/Makefile: Added apilogin test.

2010-06-07  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* client/examples/chaton-twitter: Switched from Basic authentication
	  to OAuth to access Twitter.  Requires Gauche-net-twitter package.

2010-04-12  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* client/examples/chaton-twitter (kick-reply-watcher!): run a watchdog
	  thread to prevent twitter api call from being wedged.

2010-03-26  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-archiver (filter-entry): Last fix was incorrect.  Fixed again.

2010-03-25  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-archiver (filter-entry): Fixed a bug that truncated current.dat
	  when it has less than MIN-ENTRIES entries and all entries are
	  before cut-off date.

2009-11-13  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* client/chaton/client.scm (make-handler): When an unexpected error
	  occurs within observer loop, restart the thread loop instead of
	  exitting the thread.  Unexpected error can occur time to time,
	  e.g. temporary network failures.

2009-10-26  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* client/examples/chaton-twitter (kick-reply-watcher!): Insert delay
	  before resuming watcher thread loop after capturing an error.
	  Without the delay, the thread can get into a busy loop if a
	  malfunction persists for some time (e.g. network failure).

2009-10-19  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* client/examples/chaton-twitter (make-observer): return #f when
	  observer captures an error, so that observer thread won't terminate
	  when twitter or bit.ly access fail.

2009-10-16  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* client/examples/chaton-twitter (forward-from-twitter): Only
	  forward messages from twitter by the users who follow the bridged
	  chaton room.  This eliminates bouncing of multipost messages,
	  pikcing up unintended retweets, etc.

2009-10-13  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* client/examples/chaton-twitter (kick-reply-watcher!): fixed a bug
	  in the handler clause of guard that caused to terminate watcher
	  thread.

2009-10-10  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* client/examples/chaton-twitter: Added a sample chaton-twitter bridge.

	* client/chaton/client.scm (chaton-permalink): Added utility function
	  to derive permalink from <chaton-client> and timestamp.

2009-09-21  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.scm (chaton-render-rss-1): Use html-escape-string instead
	  of safe-text for escaping TITLE elements of RSS, since safe-text
	  may insert A elements which aren't allowed in TITLE.

2009-07-29  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.scm (+show-stack-trace+): missing '@@' markers.
	  (chaton-render-from-file): enable to switch the order of entries
	  by a keyword argument newest-first.  It is better to reverse the
	  order for RSS.

2009-07-26  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.scm (chaton-render-rss-1): fix title.

	* chaton-entry (the-page), chaton.scm (+index.rdf+): Changed the
	  location of index.rdf under 'var' subdirectory; the room directory
	  may be unwritable.
	* chaton-poster (update-rss): Use extended with-output-to-file
	  to avoid race condition

	* chaton.scm (chaton-render-html-1, chaton-render-rss-1): Refactored
	  common routines.

	* chaton-poster (poster-main), chaton.scm (+show-stack-trace+),
	  sample.conf (show-stack-trace-on-error): Added configuration
	  switch to customize whether stack trace should be shown on
	  error.

2009-07-26  Kazuki Tsujimoto <kazuki@callcc.net>

	* cahton-poster (poster-main): Show stack trace when an error
	  occured.

	* chaton-poster (update-rss): Added to support RSS.
	* chaton-entry, chaton.scm: Changed accordingly.

2009-06-13  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.scm (render-url): Allow '-' in the youtube vid.

	* chaton-archiver (mklink): Ensure directory before creating the
	  symlink (only becomes a problem when archiver is invoked for the
	  first time *and* there's nothing to archive.)

2009-06-01  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-entry: Allocates client ID when the entry is accessed.
	* chaton-viewer (emit-skeleton): Fixed to carry over the client ID
	  given to the skeleton access.
	  (client-connected, emit-tail): In strict-login mode, make the server
	  reject unknown CID instead of allocating new CID.  In that case,
	  the skeleton access returns a content telling the client to reload,
	  and the json access returns cid = -1 to indicate the rejection.
	  Typical public chatroom doesn't need this feature; this is only for
	  private rooms using http authentication.
	* sample.conf (loose-login): Added a config parameter to specify
	  loose-login or strict-login mode.
	* chaton.js (insertContent): Handles cid = -1 case introduced above.

	* build-site, htaccess, sample.conf: Added settings to allow the
	  chat-room private using http basic authentication.
	* chaton-passwd: simple password changing script for private rooms.

2009-05-30  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-entry, chaton.html: Replaced chaton.html by chaton-entry
	  cgi script for preparation of issuing client ID upon accessing the
	  room.
	* build-site, README, htaccess: Changed accordingly.

2009-05-29  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-browser, chaton.css: Added wide padding below the archive view
	  so that the anchor to the post near the bottom of the archive view
	  works correctly.

2009-05-28  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* client/chaton/client.scm (make-handler): Changed observer signature;
	  now it is called as (observer <client> <message>).
	  Also exported a bunch of accessor methods as the means of proper
	  way to get values from the client.
	  Also update pos and cid slot _after_ calling the observer, so that
	  the observer can compare message's pos/cid with the previous ones.

	* client/examples/chaton-watcher: A simple command-line utility that
	  can monitor multiple chaton rooms.

2009-05-27  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-apilogin: Login returns room-name as well.

	* client/chaton/client.scm (make-handler): Retry after the comet server
	  disconnected.

	* chaton-browser (day-link): suppress generating links to the date
	  without archive data.

2009-05-26  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* search.html: The search page (using Google inurl:).
	* conf/site.conf: A new configuration parameter to specify site-wide
	  search url (instead of in-room search).
	* chaton.html: Added a link to the search page.
	* build-site: includes search.html
	* chaton.css: Added stuff for the search page.

	* chaton-browser: Added links to the days in the month in the right
	  pane (monthly-navigation).
	* chaton.css: Added some styles for the monthy navigation.

	* chaton-archiver: Switched boundary of daily archive---entries are
	  splitted at midnight of GMT, instead of localtime.
	  The archiver also creates *.cnt files, recording # of entries.
	  The old archive must be converted by running chaton-archiver with
	  --rebuild option.  (This may change some entries' permalinks; let's
	  hope it has limited effect at this point.)
	* chaton.scm (make-permalink): Changed accordingly (using GMT to
	  generate permalink url).

2009-05-25  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.scm (chaton): added +logdir+ constant.
	* chaton-archiver: Emit log to $DATADIR/logs/archive.log.
	  Revised using common constants in the chaton module for
	  the directories.

	* README: updated to reflect addition of new scripts.

2009-05-20  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.scm (*url-rx*): Better regex to capture url.

2009-05-18  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-viewer (client-connected, do-child): Changed treatment of
	  duplicate request; the most likely scenario of dup request is that
	  the intermediate node timeouts during comet keep the request waiting.
	  Comet thinks the connection is held, while the client sees it is
	  disconnected and resend the request.  Now, when we detect dup,
	  we immediately discard the dup cid and reallocate new one, and
	  proceed normal comet treatment on the new cid.  The original request
	  eventually soft-timeouts, checks if cid is still valid, and aborts
	  if the cid is invalidated (because of the dup request).

	* chaton-viewer: Changed format of S-expr version of status
	  to an alist for consistency of other parts that treat json/sexpr.

	* chaton-badge: adapted to the above change.

2009-05-17  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-apilogin: Returns icon url as well.
	* client/chaton/client.scm (<chaton-client>): Added icon-url slot.

	* chaton-viewer (do-monitor): use read-lock while checking the size,
	  to avoid the hazard if the active log is truncated during checking.
	  Also touched sources for clearity.

	* chaton.js, chaton-viewer: Changed json/s-expr field name of the
	  comet reply packet from 'text' to 'content'.

2009-05-16  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.scm (render-url): recognize capital letter suffix for images
	  as well.

2009-05-15  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* client/*: Start adding client library.

	* chaton-viewer (get-header): Read request headers.  Without properly
	  doing that, the timing of reply got screwed and some clients can't
	  receive proper reply.

2009-05-14  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-viewer: Added support for intitial CID generation for API,
	  robots.txt, and returns some reasonable status for other unsupported
	  requests.

2009-05-12  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.js (fetchContent): fix handling of disconnecting events.
	  It was wrong to use onException; Firefox calls onSuccess with empty
	  body when disconnected.

	* chaton-viewer: start adding s-expr interface.
	  Rejects duplicate request from the same cid.

	* chaton.scm (chaton-read-entries, chaton-render-from-file): split
	  atomic file reading part from chaton-render-from-file.

2009-05-11  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-apilogin: Added.
	* build-site, htaccess: Changed accordingly.

	* chaton-viewer (make-json-packet, write-status-js): Use double-quote
	  to quote field name to comply json spec (rfc4627).

2009-05-10  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.js (startWatchDog, tameWatchDog, bark): Added watchdog timer
	  for comet connection to support browsers that don't fire any events
	  when Ajax connection is lost.  The timer won't be fired in normal
	  circumstances; it only barks when Comet server is restarted but
	  the browser failed to detect it.

	* htaccess: Force charset=utf-8 for *.html, since the room description
	  may contain utf-8 characters.

	* sample.conf, chaton.css: Added right-pane including room description
	  and link to the badge.

	* chaton-badge, badge.html: Added Badge support.
	* htaccess, build-site, chaton.css: Changed accordingly.

2009-05-09  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.scm (with-output-to-file): Provides a wrapper to support
	  :atomic keyword arg, that implements a common idiom of write-to-
	  temporary-file-and-rename.
	  (+docdir+ etc.): Provides common constants.
	* chaton-poster: Adapted to the new chaton.scm.

	* chaton-viewer (emit-skeleton): Adds HTTP response header for the
	  initial skeleton.
	  (spawn-status): Writes out $(DOCDIR)/var/status.{js,scm} periodically
	  for those who wants to monitor room status (this obsoletes the old
	  var/seq file.)

2009-05-08  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-poster (increment-sequence): Saves post sequence number under
	  $DATADIR/data/sequence instead of $DOCDIR/var/seq.  The latter is
	  supported for a while until client side javascript is totally
	  updated.
	  (record-last-post-timestamp): Saves it to $DATADIR/data/last-post.

	* chaton-viewer (client-tracker): Records the current number of
	  chatters under $DATADIR/data/num-chatters.

	* chaton-browser (main): 'a/yesterday' link to redirect to
	  the yesterday's archive.
	* chaton.html: "Read archive" link points to a/yesterday.

	* chaton-archiver: Rewrote to handle multiple past dates with
	  sane DST handling, and also allow to leave some minimum amount
	  of entries in current.dat instead of truncating it strictly
	  to the today's entry.

2009-05-07  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.scm (chaton-with-shared-locking,chaton-with-exclusive-locking):
	  Put locking primitives here.
	* chaton-poster (poster-main): Adapted to use the locking primitive
	  in chaton.scm.  Wrapped main code with define-module for
	  testing.

	* chaton.js: If the user is scrolling up to read past messages,
	  do not scroll to botton when contents is added.  (Thanks to
	  Toru Hisai for the hint).

	* chaton-archiver (filter-entry): Adapted to the new data file
	  format.

2009-05-06  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton.js (initViewFrame), chaton-viewer (make-skeleton): Put
	  one trampoline of setTimeout before start fetching the content
	  into iframe; Safari apparently doesn't like the JapaScript open
	  Comet connection within the onLoad handler (the browser window
	  stays "loading..." state.)

	* chaton-viewer (emit-tail), chaton.js (fetchContent): Manage clients
	  using clients ids.  If no status change, ping back to a client
	  in much longer time (~5min) than before (~45sec) for less traffic.
	  Also tracks # of clients more precisely, though there is some
	  delay involved.

	* chaton-poster (make-entry): Record remote IP as well.
	* chaton.scm (chaton-render-1): Adapted to the new entry.

	* chaton.js (enablePost): moves focus forcibly to fix a weird
	  behavior of dissapearing cursor in the textarea.

	* chaton-archiver (chore-for-the-day): Create a link two days
	  advance.  Because we can't start archiving data for, say, 1/10,
	  until it's 1/11, and at that moment we need 1/11's link has to
	  be already created.  Who create that link?  The archiver process
	  that ran 1/10, which archived the data for 1/9.  Thus we need
	  to create link for two days beyond the date we're archiving.

	* chaton-viewer: Added -r option (restart) and -c option (check)
	  for ease of server management.

2009-05-05  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* chaton-viewer (emit-tail, spawn-monitor): fixed *mutex* treatment.
	  (emit-skeleton): no need to read out *text-map* yet.
	  (main): Added graceful termination by signalling, write pid file
	  for management, and -k option to kill the running server.

	* build-site: Check if chaton.js needs to be updated, and if not,
	  do not replace chaton.js (and the viewer's version).

	* chaton-browser (make-page): Changed title display.

	* chaton-archiver, chaton-viewer, chaton-browser, chaton-poster:
	  Changed current.dat and archive directory under $DATADIR/data/,
	  and log directory under $DATADIR/logs/, respectievly.  Since
	  the directory where current.dat exists must be writable from
	  CGI scripts, it is safe to put them into a subdir so that
	  we can secure $DATADIR itself.
	* build-site (do-build): Ensure new directory strcuture, and
	  also create the data files if it does not exist.

	* chaton.js: Sets nickname cookie even post-text is empty; allowing
	  the client to change nickname without actually posting a message.
