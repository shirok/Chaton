== API

=== Create a connection

`<chaton-client>`

An object holding info about a connection to a room.

Accessors for the client instance:

- `(chaton-room-url client)` - Returns room url
- `(chaton-room-name client)` - Returns room name
- `(chaton-post-url client)` - URL to post messages
- `(chaton-comet-url client)` - URL of the comet server
- `(chaton-icon-url client)` - URL for the room icon
- `(chaton-cid client)` - Client id (integer), unique number for each connected client
- `(chaton-pos client)` - The last position (integer) of the message stream this client has retrieved
- `(chaton-observer-error client)` - The last error conditon occurred in the communication.  `#f` if no error have occurred.

To obtain a new connection, you can call `chaton-connect`:

`(chaton-connect room-url client-name :optional observer retry-count)` â‡’ `<chaton-client>`

This connects to a room specified with _room-url_.
The _client-name_ is a string name used only for logging in the server side.

The _observer_ argument is called back with two arguments,
the `<chaton-client>` object, and an object indicating the event.

. If it is a message event, the second argument is an alist with the following items:
  * `pos` - An integer position of the message
  * `nc` - The number of active clients
  * `ver` - The chaton room's version
  * `cid` - The client ID (integer)
  * `content` - This can be either one of the following:
    ** `(nickname (timestamp-sec timestamp-nsec) text)` - A post
    ** `()` - Indicating this message is mearly notify the current position.
. If it is an error event, the second argument is a `<chaton-error>` object.
It is usually a communication problem such as the server disconnected.
After returning from _observer_, the client tries to eestablishes the
connection periodically.  If you want to abandon the monitoring you should
throw an exception from _observer_.

The return value of _observer_ is discarded.

Note that _observer_ is called in a thread monitoring the room.

To post a text, use the following procedure.

`(chaton-talk client nickname text)`

Post a _text_ with the nickname _nickname_.  Note that we don't have
a concept of "user" in Chaton.  You can use any nickname.

Finally, the following procedure disconnects from the room.

`(chaton-bye client)`
